# CalCOFI Data Analytics for Water Temperature Prediction DA_assig-1

Welcome to the CalCOFI Data Analytics repository! 
This project focuses on predicting water temperature using historical data from the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to develop accurate models that can forecast water temperatures based on various environmental features.

## Introduction
The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) program collects oceanographic data off the coast of California and the United States-Mexico border. In this project, we utilize historical data from CalCOFI to build predictive models for water temperature. By analyzing the relationships between various environmental factors and water temperature, we can make informed predictions about future temperature trends.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of historical CalCOFI data, including measurements of water temperature and various environmental variables. The dataset is available in the dataset directory. Please note that due to the nature of oceanographic data, missing values and outliers may be present. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to ensure the quality of the dataset for model training.
